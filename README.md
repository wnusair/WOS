## How to Install for Regular Use
- First, click download on the Github page.
- Next, go to [python.org](python.org) and install the most [recent version](python.org/downloads).

![PythonRecent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75694885/175171518-9f4205f1-2e34-4296-ac94-743cb2eb5069.png)

When you open the folder, there are three files visible:
```
download_dependencies.bat
README-BEFORE-STARTING-ANYTHING.txt
run.bat
```

If this is your first time installing WOS, open the `download_dependencies.bat` file. This will install all the necessary packages that WOS needs.

Once the popup says that everything is done downloading (or closes automatically), open the `run.bat` file.

## How to Install for Developers
- First, click download on the Github page.
- Next, go to [python.org](python.org) and install the most [recent version](python.org/downloads).

![PythonRecent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75694885/175171518-9f4205f1-2e34-4296-ac94-743cb2eb5069.png)

- Once you install python, go to your terminal/console.
- Inside the terminal/console, type pip help.
- If an error shows up, contact me.
- If it shows a bunch of options, you are good to go.
- The last thing you need to do is type in your terminal/console:
  ```
  pip install tkinter
  pip install tqdm
  pip install cryptography
  ``` 
 
## How to Login
You will be greeted with a prompt asking for your IP_ADDRESS. Above this prompt, will be your *IPv4 address* displayed like this:

![image](../github/IPv4.png)

You will then be asked for a `port`, the default is 9999

The password is `wissamiscool22`

### Congrats! You have logged into Wissam OS!

<br>

## Two Options
Once you login, you will beee greeted with the ASCII logo, and two options. This part of the README.MD file will help you navigate.

### How to open Files
There are two ways to open files.
- Type "1"
- Type "files" capitalized or lower case

## Files Menu
When you open files, it will show a tree of all the files in that directory (I am planning on making a seperate folder for personal files). Anyway, you will see three options:
1. Press "1" to open a file.
2. Press '2' to edit or create a file.
3. Press '3' to exit.

Each option is pretty self explanatory. Once you click an option, you will have to type the name of the file. If the file is in a seperate folder, type the name of the folder, slash, the name of thefile.

An example:
folder/file.filetype

### How to open Applications
There are three ways to open applications.
- Type "1"
- Type "apps" capitalized or lower case
- Type "applications" capitalied or lower case.

## Application Menu

### NOTE, THIS SECTION IS NOT ACURATE AND WILL BE UPDATED AS PER OUR 1.5.0 UPDATE
When you open the application menu, it will show three options:
1. fileSendServer
2. fileSendClient
3. CPP (File Encryption)

### CPP
Once you type "CPP" or "cpp" on the application menu, it will open a seperate GUI.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75694885/175177737-4ba8a5d0-7b75-4115-be34-7dc6c4aaedaf.png)

When you select option one (encrypt file), it will ask for the file you wish to encrypt. Like the file menu, you have to type the name of they file. If it is in a another folder, you have to type the name of the folder.

NOTE: THIS WILL NOT WORK UNLESS THE FILE IS IN THE WOS DIRECTORY OR ABOVE!

The second option is to decrypt a file, it works the same way as encryption, but it does the oposite. Option three deletes a file, like all the other options, you have to type the name of the file.

Type "4" to exit. It will exit the program, I am working on a solution.

Now, it is time for what you have been waiting for...

# The Cloud
This section talks about the cloud, how to access it, how to use it, and how it works.

NOTE: IN ORDER TO USE THE CLOUD, YOU MUST TYPE IN YOUR CORRECT IPv4 ADDRESS. TO LEARN HOW, GO TO [HOW TO LOG IN](#how-to-log-in)

## How to Access the SCloud
In order to access the SCloud, you must log in with your correct IPv4 address. Once you have logged in:
1. Go to the applications menu.
2. Type "fileSendClient" (I am going to change the name).
3. Type in your IPv4 address and PORT (default 9999).
4. Once you have opend the SCloud client, type "tree."
5. If a list of file names is printed, you are connected!

In the last image when I typed "tree," the reason why nothing showed up was because I did not activate the server.

## How to Use the SCloud
There are a few commands that can be run.
```
upload
download
cmd
tree
```

### Upload
When you type "upload," a window will pop up. Select the file of your choice, and press open. Once the file uploads, it will be in the cloud, and it will show a message.

### Download
When you type download, you also have to type the file and type name after.
eg: download test.txt

This is how you can download files from the cloud

### CMD
When you type cmd, it will run a terminal/console command.

You also have to type the command after you type "cmd."

Example: cmd echo hi

You need to know basic terminal/console commands to be able to use this.

### Tree
This command lists all the files in the cloud. I am working on making it look better (it currently looks ugly).
This command lets you know if you are connected to the SCloud. If nothing shows up after you type the command, you are not connected.

## How SCloud works
SCloud works by using the Python library, socket. It is pretty simple. I have a server at home with code that allows clients to connect to it.

Socket allows the client and server to be able to transfer files, and commands.

The server has about 100 GB of storage.

## Personal Use
- Why would you use this program? It is really simple. If you need to upload a large file, I mean Gigabytes worth, you would be hesitant to use your OneDrive, ICloud, or Google Drive. These services offer limited storage, and it is mainly for personal documents, images, etc. With unlimited storage (limited to the machine you are using), the possibilities are endless.

- Another potential use is file sharing. If you have ever wanted to share large files, you are often met with a limit of only a few megabytes. With WOS, there is no limit.

- The last feature that is probably going to be used the most, is the fact that you can run any application on WOS. I realized you could use the built-in terminal to run a command to start an EXE file (maybe the same on MAC). I decided to download an app, like steam, then I went to where all the files were stored. I moved all of them to the "src" folder, and ran a command to start the app (start steam.exe). I am currently working on a feature to be able to run apps without making the folders messy.

# Closing Remarks
I am going to add more to this project. If you read to the end, email me, "I read to the end ðŸ§€" I will give you a surprise.
